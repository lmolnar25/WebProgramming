    <h1>About Lab 2</h1>
    <p>
      In this lab I’m exploring how to create structured HTML pages that include
      features like tables, hyperlinks, and navigation elements. The lab
      emphasizes the importance of creating structured and organized web pages
      that can serve as the foundation for more complex projects. By applying
      these concepts, I’m learning how to organize content effectively and
      create more accessible websites for everyone. I’m excited to continue my
      journey in web programming and explore new ways to create engaging and
      interactive web pages!
