         I found out that by default inline elements like <img> and <a> can cause spacing 
         problems. Setting display: block; makes them behave like block-level 
         elements, making them start on new lines and take up full width. */

    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage!</h1>

    <p>
      In my Web Programming class IT2310, I am learning the fundamentals of HTML
      and exploring how to build websites. I'm also discovering the power and
      efficiency of Visual Studio Code as my code editor as well as extensions
      like Prettier. I also learned a bit about how to use Windows Powershell
      and BASH for commands!
    </p>

    <p>
      It's <strong>exciting</strong> to see how code transforms into interactive
      webpages like this one. I'm looking forward to learning more about HTML,
      CSS, and Javascript to create more complex and interactive websites.
    </p>
