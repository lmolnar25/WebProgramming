# Web-Programming-Repository
Repository for IT-2310 Web Programming class.

## Lesson 1 - 1/13 - 1/20: Lab 1 Assignment
#### Filename: [lab1-intro.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab1-intro.html)
#### lab1-intro.html is my first HTML webpage document. It demonstrates basic usage of HTML elements like headings (h1), paragraphs (p), hyperlinks (a), and images (img). I've also included a CSS style to improve the layout of the image and the hyperlink. This project serves as a starting point for me in learning HTML and exploring the fundamentals of web development.

## Lesson 2 - 1/20 - 1/27: Lab 2 Assignment
#### Filename: [lab2-home.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab2-home.html)
#### Filename: [lab2-about.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab2-about.html)
#### This project focuses on creating structured HTML pages with tables and hyperlinks, reinforcing essential web development concepts. Through lab2-home.html and lab2-about.html, I learned how to organize content using tables, connect pages with relative and absolute links, and create a simple navigation system. These skills will be valuable as I continue learning about web development, providing a strong foundation for integrating CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced design techniques in the future!
