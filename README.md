# Web-Programming-Repository
Repository for IT-2310 Web Programming class.

## Lesson 1 - 1/13 - 1/20: Lab 1 Assignment
#### Filename: [lab1-intro.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab1-intro.html)
#### lab1-intro.html is my first HTML webpage document. It demonstrates basic usage of HTML elements like headings (h1), paragraphs (p), hyperlinks (a), and images (img). I've also included a CSS style to improve the layout of the image and the hyperlink. This project serves as a starting point for me in learning HTML and exploring the fundamentals of web development.

## Lesson 2 - 1/20 - 1/27: Lab 2 Assignment
#### Filename: [lab2-home.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab2-home.html)
#### Filename: [lab2-about.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab2-about.html)
#### This project focuses on creating structured HTML pages with tables and hyperlinks, reinforcing essential web development concepts. Through lab2-home.html and lab2-about.html, I learned how to organize content using tables, connect pages with relative and absolute links, and create a simple navigation system. These skills will be valuable as I continue learning about web development, providing a strong foundation for integrating CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced design techniques in the future!

## Lesson 3 - 1/27 - 2/3: Lab 3 Assignment
#### Filename: [lab3-forms.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab3-forms.html)
#### This lab assignment focuses on creating a web form using HTML to collect a coffee order, which is a practical application of several key HTML concepts. Through this assignment, I've gained experience in implementing various form controls, including text input fields, email fields, dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and text areas. It also taught me how to use the (form) element to structure the form, set the submission destination and method with the action and method attributes. Overall, this lab reinforced my understanding of HTML elements to create an interactive form that collects user input.
