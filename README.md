# HTML-CSS-Class-Projects
Repository HTML labs for IT-2310 Web Programming.

## Lesson 1 - 1/13 - 1/20: Lab 1 Assignment
#### Filename: [lab1-intro.html](https://github.com/lmolnar25/WebProgramming/blob/main/lab1-intro.html)
#### lab1-intro.html is my first HTML webpage document. It demonstrates basic usage of HTML elements like headings (h1), paragraphs (p), hyperlinks (a), and images (img). I've also included a CSS style to improve the layout of the image and the hyperlink. This project serves as a starting point for me in learning HTML and exploring the fundamentals of web development.
